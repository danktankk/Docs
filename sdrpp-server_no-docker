Full Setup for SDR++ in Server Mode (No Audio Config Required)
This guide will walk you through setting up SDR++ in server mode on a Linux system, without requiring audio configuration. The steps are designed to be minimal and secure, using a dedicated user for running the SDR++ service.

Prerequisites
A Linux system with apt package manager (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian)
Access to the terminal with sudo privileges
Step 1: Install Dependencies (Minimal)
Update your system and install basic tools. Note that audio-related dependencies like alsa-utils are generally not required for this setup, but you can include them if necessary.

bash
Save
Copy
1
2
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y alsa-utils  # Optional, only if absolutely needed
Step 2: Create a Dedicated SDR++ User
For security reasons, it's recommended to run the SDR++ server under a dedicated user account with limited privileges.

bash
Save
Copy

sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false sdrpp
sudo mkdir /home/sdrpp
sudo chown -R sdrpp:sdrpp /home/sdrpp
sudo usermod -aG plugdev,dialout sdrpp
Step 3: Install SDR++
Download the SDR++ .deb package that matches your system architecture (e.g., sdrpp_ubuntu_noble_amd64.deb), and then install it.

bash
Save
Copy
1
2
sudo dpkg -i sdrpp_ubuntu_noble_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -f  # Resolves missing dependencies, if any
Step 4: Set Up the SDR++ Systemd Service
To ensure SDR++ starts automatically in server mode on system boot, create a systemd service file.

Create the service file:
bash
Save
Copy
1
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/sdrpp-server.service
Add the following configuration to the file:
ini

[Unit]
Description=SDR++ Server Mode
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=sdrpp
Group=sdrpp
ExecStart=/usr/bin/sdrpp --server
Restart=always
Environment="HOME=/home/sdrpp"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Save and close the file (CTRL + X, then Y, followed by Enter).
Step 5: Enable and Start the SDR++ Service
Make sure the systemd configuration is reloaded, enable the service to start on boot, and then start it immediately.

bash
Save
Copy
1
2
3
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable sdrpp-server.service
sudo systemctl start sdrpp-server.service
Verify that the service is running correctly:

bash
Save
Copy
1
sudo systemctl status sdrpp-server.service
You should see an output indicating that the service is active and running.

Conclusion
You have now successfully set up SDR++ to run in server mode, starting automatically on system boot. This setup is minimal, secure, and does not require audio configuration. Enjoy using your SDR++ server!
