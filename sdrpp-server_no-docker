# Full Setup for SDR++ in Server Mode (No Audio Config Required)

This guide walks through setting up SDR++ in server mode on an Ubuntu Server. It includes creating a dedicated user, configuring the service to run automatically on startup, and omitting unnecessary audio configurations.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y alsa-utils  # Optional, only if needed for other dependencies
