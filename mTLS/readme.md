## What is mTLS?

Mutual TLS (mTLS) is an enhanced version of Transport Layer Security (TLS) where **both** the client and the server authenticate each other using certificates. In a typical TLS setup, only the server presents a certificate to prove its identity to the client. With mTLS, **both parties must present and validate certificates**, establishing two-way trust. This provides strong authentication and is commonly used in **zero-trust networks**, **internal API security**, and **service-to-service communication** where strict identity verification is required.

## Guide Status

This guide is **mostly complete** and covers the key concepts of getting it working in your HomeLab, including setup instructions with appropriate credits given, for implementing mTLS. However, it will require some **further refinements and adjustments** to ensure it applies correctly to at least my specific **infrastructure and security policies**. Final tuning and validation in your environment are recommended before considering the implementation production-ready.
